1. Using camel case for variables and constants.
2. Using upper camel case for classes and structs.
3. Choosing good parameter names that serve as documentation.
4. Opening method braces and other braces (if/else/switch/while etc.) on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.
5. Colons always have no space on the left and one space on the right.
6. When they are needed, use comments to explain why a particular piece of code does something. Comments must be kept up-to-date or deleted.
7. Specify types for properties, variables, constants, argument declarations and other statements with a space after the colon but not before.
8. Always using 'let' instead of 'var' if the value of the variable will not change.
9. Prefer the shortcut versions of type declarations over the full generics syntax.
