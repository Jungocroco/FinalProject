## week 1
# day 5: Created the launchscreen and the searchscreen. Linked the searchscreen to a class and started reading into the Yelp API.

## week 2
# day 1: Continued reading into the Yelp API, requested authorization and tried to implent this into a controller.
# day 2: Authorization strangely did not work yet, so started with the design of the cells and labels.
# day 3: Watched tutorials on JSON parsing. Authorization of Yelp API finished.
# day 4: Tried to write the search function for YELP.
# day 5: Continued writing the search function for YELP, finished it and retrieved the needed data.

## week 3
# day 1: Created a businesscell class and linked it up. Image retrieval did not work yet.
# day 2: Went on to research the MapKit. Lots of different types and options discovered and selected.
# day 3: Integrated mapview, buggy but reasonably working. Looked further into discogs and found out the API did not support what I initially had in mind.
# day 4:  Rewrote concept of the app. Created annotations per store to be used in the map.
# day 5: Did most of the callout accessory work, which was way more effort than expected. In the end the map worked how it should

## week 4
# day 1: Created an error alert for the search. Implemented a default image for when retrieval fails. Added an OpenUrl and OpenMaps function within the callout.
# day 2: Converted the usage of Safari to a WebView from the WebKit. App seemed bugfree, only design tasks to do. Cleaned code.
# day 3: Overwrote Xcode project with deprecated version via git pull.. Costed the rest of the day to get back on track.
# day 4: Cleaned code and polished the code layout.
