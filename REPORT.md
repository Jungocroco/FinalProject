- Start with a short description of your application (like in the README.md, but very short, including a single screen shot).

Record Store Explore is all about finding, routing and visiting record stores in an area of choice. A combination of the Yelp and Maps API provided for an interface in which the user can search,select and discover stores in a fast and easy way.

- Clearly describe the technical design: how is the functionality implemented in your code? This should be like your DESIGN.md but updated to reflect the final application. First, give a high level overview, which helps us navigate and understand the total of your code (which components are there?). Second, go into detail, and describe the modules/classes (apps) files/functions (data) and how they relate.

The technical design consists of a couple of different features, working together and anticipating on the user's actions. Firstly the user will be confronted with a search screen, whereafter a tableview opens with the found record stores. After selecting on of the stores a mapview will open, centered on the previous selected store's pin. When the pin is touched a callout opens with two accesories and the main- and subtitle enlarged. The left accessory links the user to the store's website (if existent) or Yelp page. The right one will open Maps and routes to the store automatically. When in mapview, all other stores and their coherent pins are visible and interactive as well.

On a more detailed level. The SearchViewController transports the text input to the StoreViewController in which a Yelp Authorization and Search processes the query and fills an array with YLPBusiness objects. This array is then used within two tableview functions that initialize the cells and the amount of rows in the table. The cells are of the BusinessCell class and get their labels and image configured with data from the businesses array. When a store is selected The MapViewController is opened and starts to append the businesses as StorePin objects to a new array. These StorePin objects are added as "MKAnnotation's" and can therefore be added to the correct location on the map. The rest of the controller mostly configures all the different settings and layout for the pins, the compass, user-tracking and callouts. To be specific, the left callout button activates a segue to a final WebViewController. Herein the custom url is opened in an integrated webview inside the app. The url contains code that automatically links to the first Google Search result, disregarding Google's website itself. The second callout uses the corresponding annotation to open Maps and route to the coherent location.

- Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document (from the PROCESS.md). Here, we can see how much you have learned in the past month.

There were some difficulties I got my head around in the last couple of weeks. Firstly it was the authorization of the Yelp API that became a lot more complex than initially explained online. With this problem I started to work on the other controllers. This is where I found out that if I wanted to make a smooth and good looking map, I had to do quite some research on the different annotations, views and pins. In the meantime I thought Discogs would be the least hard part. This turned out to be the opposite when it became clear the API didn't support to search on seller. This made it impossible to connect the stores from Yelp to the coherent Discogs record assortment. As a result I needed to change the concept op my app, which made me put more effort in the configuration of the mapview and the callout accessories. Yelp turned out to work fine and gave me almost everything I needed. The only thing missing was a url to the store's website, so I searched on a way to link to Google's first result in the callout.


- Defend your decisions by writing an argument of a most a single paragraph. Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs for your current solution? In an ideal world, given much more time, would you choose another solution?

With the time given I think I made the right choices in light of efficiency and usability. The alternative of showing the Store's site or Yelp page gives enough information to continue the exploration of the store, after the possibilities the app already gave you: searching, finding and routing. The app does what it does and I think it does it in a pretty smooth way. In an ideal world I would still like to implement a table with the most recent assortment the store got their hands on. In the end, if enough time is given and more datasources can be used at the same time, it should be possible.
