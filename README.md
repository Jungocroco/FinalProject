# Problem statement.

For the lack of an app that combines record store locations and assortment, this is it. Record stores often don't care that much about their websites and focus on the physical stores. To locate record stores and instantly route to their location or website at the same time within one app makes for a more efficient recorddigging session. As a result one can decide to visit the physical shop and route to it or make plans for a later visit and link to it's website.


# Solution.

The goal is to create an all-in-one record store finder.
Main features:
- Map with record stores shown
- Yelp Guide with the default settings of record stores
- Routing to the store from current location via Maps


# Prerequisites.

# Data sources:
- Yelp, https://www.yelp.nl/developers/documentation/v3/business_search
  - Data may have to be transformed before usable
- MapKit
  
 # Frameworks:
 - IOS MapKit

Review of similar mobile apps:
There is no specifically similar app to what i propose. The app links to a browser or map and is thereby a newcomer in its sort. The Yelp app only shows reviews and locations, but no routing.
